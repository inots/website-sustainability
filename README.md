Our use of the internet is usually considered a more sustainable and environmentally friendly alternative to more traditional ways of producing and consuming information. Even though this holds true to some extent, this overgeneralization has led to a general disregard of the environmental impact of the internet and digital products in general. This paper presents literature regarding sustainability in web development, specifically focusing on environmentally conscious practices in sustainable website development and design. By adopting sustainable web design practices, companies and organizations can reduce their environmental impact and improve the sustainability of the internet as a whole while also improving the experience of the users.
